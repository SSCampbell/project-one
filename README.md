# Sparta Global Academy Game Project

## Project Review:

#### The Game project was proposed to use all the skills learned from the past weeks to create a web-based game which uses HTML/CSS/JS.

## Functionality:

### This game has a basic format which features a main screen to present the player's information and the grid in which the player would be interacting with. The page also has three Modal boxes that will appear from the top relating to the current situation of the game. At the beginning the first box appears, the second/third boxes appear when the user has either won or lost. HTML was used to structure the page layout. CSS sheet was used to modify how the information is visually presented to the screen. JS was used to create the variables, functions and link data between the HTML page and the JQUERY code.

## Implementation:
#### -Atom
#### -CSS
#### -HTML
#### -JS/JQUERY

## How To Play The Game:

#### The game starts with the user welcomed from the menu screen. The introduction text explains how to play the game, then the user is asked to input their name. When they do, their profile on the left will show them their profile information.

#### As the game starts the user is able to see where the pirate ships are for a set amount of time. After the set time, the boats vanish and now the user is working with their memory to defeat all the pirates. The user can collect telescopes to see the boats again for a set time.

#### Finally, the game ends when the user has ran out of cannons or defeated all the pirates. The user is present with the corresponding screen relating to the outcome of the game and asked if they would like to play again.
